# flutter_base_project

A valuable repository for starting a flutter project. It has Clean Architecture and uses GetX as state management. After cloning, press ctrl+shift+R and replace flutter_base_project with whatever you want. After that, rename the flutter_base_project.imi and flutter_base_project_android.imi files to your new app name. Remember to remove the .idea folder and reopen the project to apply all changes without errors.

Hope you best
